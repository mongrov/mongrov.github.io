          <h2 class="mt-0">Introduction</h2>
          <p>Our privacy policy will help you understand what information we collect at Tao - Tamil chat app, how Tao - Tamil chat appuses it, and what choices you have.</p>
          <p>When we talk about “Tao - Tamil chat app”, “https://taotamil.com/”, Mongrov,“we,” “our,” or “us” in this policy, we are referring to Mongrov, Inc., the company which provides the Services. When we talk about the “Services” in this policy, we are referring to our online moderated communities or workplace productivity tools and platform. Our Services are currently available for use via a web browser or applications specific to your desktop or mobile device, as further described in our product section.</p>
          <h2 class="space-1">Information we collect and receive</h2>
          <h3>1. Customer Data</h3>
          <p>Content and information submitted by users to the Services is referred to in this policy as “Customer
            Data.” As further explained below, Customer Data is controlled by the organization or other third party that
            created the team (the “Customer”). Where Mongrov collects or processes Customer Data, it does so on behalf
            of the Customer. Here are some examples of Customer Data (but keep in mind they are only examples and there
            may be others): messages (including those in channels and direct messages), pictures, videos, edits to
            messages or deleted messages, and other types of files. A user may also choose to enter information into
            their profile, such as first and last name, job, a photo and a phone number.</p>
          <p>If you join a team and create a user account, you are a “user,” as further described in the
            <a href="user-terms.html">user terms of service</a> are using the Services by invitation
            of a Customer, whether that Customer is your employer, another organization, or an individual, that Customer
            determines its own policies regarding storage, access, modification, deletion, sharing, and retention of
            Customer Data which may apply to your use of the Services. Please check with the Customer about the policies
            and settings it has in place.</p>
          <h3 class="mt-5">2. Other information</h3>
          <p>Mongrov may also collect and receive the following information:
            <br>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Account creation information. Users provide information such as an email address and password to create
              an account.
            </li>
            <li>Team setup information. When a Customer creates a team using the Services, we collect an email address,
              a team name, domain details (such as team-name.Mongrov), user name for the individual setting up the team,
              and password.</li>
            <li>Billing and other information. For Customers that purchase a paid version of the Services, our corporate
              affiliates and our third party payment processors may collect and store billing address and credit card
              information on our behalf or we may do this ourselves.</li>
            <li>Services usage information. This is information about how you are accessing and using the Services,
              which may include administrative and support communications with us and information about the teams,
              channels, people, features, content, and links you interact with, and what third party integrations you
              use (if any).</li>
            <li>Contact information. With your permission, any contact information you choose to import is collected
              (such as an address book from a device) when using the Services.</li>
            <li>Log data. When you use the Services our servers automatically record information, including information
              that your browser sends whenever you visit a website or your mobile app sends when you are using it. This
              log data may include your Internet Protocol address, the address of the web page you visited before using
              the Services, your browser type and settings, the date and time of your use of the Services, information
              about your browser configuration and plug-ins, language preferences, and cookie data.</li>
            <li>Device information. We may collect information about the device you are using the Services on, including
              what type of device it is, what operating system you are using, device settings, application IDs, unique
              device identifiers, and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on
              what type of device you are using and its settings.</li>
            <li>Geo-location information. Precise GPS location from mobile devices is collected only with your
              permission. WiFi and IP addresses received from your browser or device may be used to determine
              approximate location.</li>
            <li>Services integrations. If, when using the Services, you integrate with a third party service, we will
              connect that service to ours. The third party provider of the integration may share certain information
              about your account with Mongrov. However, we do not receive or store your passwords for any of these third
              party services.</li>
            <li>Third party data. Mongrov may also receive information from affiliates in our corporate group, our
              partners, or others that we use to make our own information better or more useful. This might be aggregate
              level information, such as which IP addresses go with which zip codes, or it might be more specific
              information, such as about how well an online marketing or email campaign performed.</li>
          </ul>
          <p></p>
          <h2 class="mt-5">Our Cookie Policy</h2>
          <p>Mongrov uses cookies and similar technologies like single-pixel gifs and web beacons, to record log data.
            We use both session-based and persistent cookies.</p>
          <p>Cookies are small text files sent by us to your computer and from your computer or mobile device to us each
            time you visit our website or use our desktop application. They are unique to your account or your browser.
            Session-based cookies last only while your browser is open and are automatically deleted when you close your
            browser. Persistent cookies last until you or your browser delete them or until they expire.</p>
          <p>Some cookies are associated with your account and personal information in order to remember that you are
            logged in and which teams you are logged into. Other cookies are not tied to your account but are unique and
            allow us to carry out site analytics and customization, among other similar things. If you access the
            Services through your browser, you can manage your cookie settings there but if you disable some or all
            cookies you may not be able to use the Services.</p>
          <p>Mongrov sets and accesses our own cookies on the domains operated by Mongrov and its corporate affiliates.
            In addition, we use third parties like Google Analytics for website analytics. You may opt-out of third
            party cookies from Google Analytics on its website. We do not currently recognize or respond to
            browser-initiated Do Not Track signals as there is no consistent industry standard for compliance.</p>
          <h2 class="mt-5">How we use your information</h2>
          <p>We use your information to provide and improve the Services.</p>
          <h3 class="mt-5">1. Customer Data</h3>
          <p>Mongrov may access and use Customer Data as reasonably necessary and in accordance with Customer’s
            instructions to (a) provide, maintain and improve the Services; (b) to prevent or address service, security,
            technical issues or at a Customer’s request in connection with customer support matters; (c) as required by
            law or as permitted by the Data Request Policy and (d) as set forth in our agreement with the Customer or as
            expressly
            permitted in writing by the Customer. Additional information about Mongrov’s confidentiality and security
            practices with respect to Customer Data is available at our Security practices page.</p>
          <h3 class="mt-5">2. Other information</h3>
          <p>We use other kinds of information in providing the Services. Specifically:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>To understand and improve our Services. We carry out research and analyze trends to better understand
              how users are using the Services and improve them.</li>
            <li>To communicate with you by:</li>
            <li>Responding to your requests. If you contact us with a problem or question, we will use your information
              to respond.
            </li>
            <li>Sending emails and Mongrov messages. We may send you Service and administrative emails and messages. We
              may also contact you to inform you about changes in our Services, our Service offerings, and important
              Service related notices, such as security and fraud notices. These emails and messages are considered part
              of the Services and you may not opt-out of them. In addition, we sometimes send emails about new product
              features or other news about Mongrov. You can opt out of these at any time.</li>
            <li>Billing and account management. We use account data to administer accounts and keep track of billing and
              payments.
            </li>
            <li>Communicating with you and marketing. We often need to contact you for invoicing, account management and
              similar reasons. We may also use your contact information for our own marketing or advertising purposes.
              You can opt out of these at any time in writing to us at
              <a href="mailto:optout@mongrov.com"><span>optout@mongrov.com</span></a>.</li>
            <li>Investigating and preventing bad stuff from happening. We work hard to keep the Services secure and to
              prevent abuse and fraud.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This policy is not intended to place any limits on what we do with data that is aggregated and/or
            de-identified so it is no longer associated with an identifiable user or Customer of the Services.</p>
          <h2 class="mt-5">Your choices</h3>
            <h3 class="mt-5">1. Customer Data</h3>
            <p>Customer provides us with instructions on what to do with Customer Data. A Customer has many choices and
              control over Customer Data. For example, Customer may provision or deprovision access to the Services,
              enable or disable third party integrations, manage permissions, retention and export settings, transfer or
              assign teams, share channels, or consolidate teams or channels with other teams or channels. Since these
              choices and instructions may result in the access, use, disclosure, modification or deletion of certain or
              all Customer Data, please review the
              <a href="index.html">product feature</a> pages for more information about these
              choices and instructions.</p>
            <h3 class="mt-5">2. Other information</h4>
              <p>If you have any questions about your information, our use of this information, or your rights when it
                comes
                to any of the foregoing, contact us at
                <a href="mailto:feedback@mongrov.com"><span>feedback@mongrov.com</span></a>.</p>
              <h2 class="mt-5">Other Choices</h2>
              <p>In addition, the browser you use may provide you with the ability to control cookies or other types of
                local data storage. Your mobile device may provide you with choices around how and whether location or
                other
                data is collected and shared. Mongrov does not control these choices, or default settings, which are
                offered
                by makers of your browser or mobile device operating system.</p>
